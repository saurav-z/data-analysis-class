Statistic- It is branch of science that deals with collection of data, analysis of dtaa and presenting the data.
Data - Any piece of information that can be saved
Measurement of central tendency mean median and mode
Outliers : The data which is significantly different from other data.


Mean: Average
Mode: Highest repeated Frequency
Median: Mid Value
Measures of dispersion:  1 Variance
                         2 Statistics is a branch of science that deals with the collection of the data, analysis of data and presenting the data.

Anything you store is data. 

* Measures of central tendency

Mean, median, and mode

Mean- Mean is an average value, suppose the datas are 10,20,30. Then, the mean of the data is 20.
But jastai euta class ma there are 5 people, 20,22,21,20,92, then esko average 35 aacha but mostly ta 20-30 ko ma matra cha aged manche haru, so 92 le ta arulai determine garyo which is wrong, so 92 is an outlier

Outlier- Outlier is a data that is significantly different than the other datas.

So, esto outlier bhako case ma, mean le euta average data dine bhayena, so in that case we need median

Suppose the datas are, 20,21,22,23,92 i.e odd number of datas then, biccha ko value which is 22 is the median
Incase the datas are 20,21,22,23 i.e even number of datas, then bicchako values ta 21 ra 22 cha, so 21+22/2 is the median in this case.

Mode is the highest repeated frequency. 


Suppose order garda, MOMO- 50 jana le bhanyo, Pizza- 20 jana le bhanyo, Noodles-1 jana le bhanyo, so since momo dherai le maga ko cha, so momo is the mode of the data

* Measures of dispersion

Dispersion- data charrinu

Suppose datas are 20,20,20,22,22,22. Then, esko mean 21 ho
And suppose another data 10,15,20,25,30,35, esko mean pani 21 nai ho but yo case ma data badi scatter bhacha, so esma variance of data dherai cha

Standard deviation- It calculates kati le data charreko cha bhanera.Standard Deviation



Numoy Advantage - It is very fast because it is written in C and C++
		- It is free and open-source
        
        
        
Pandas

Pandas is built on top of numpy
Pandas is free and open source
Pandas is very fasr and efficient to work with large datasets
